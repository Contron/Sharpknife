# Sharpknife

A C# library to assist with Windows Presentation Foundation desktop application development.

Although I primarily use it as my own personal framework, it may be useful to others.

# Features

* Tailored for the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern
* Classes for commands, notifications, and window management
* Classes for persistence and utilities
